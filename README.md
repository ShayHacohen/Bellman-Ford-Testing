# Bellman-Ford-Testing
Just a simple implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find distances & shortest path trees from a given source vertex in connected digraphs.

Was in the mood to play around with graphs a little bit. The graphs here are mostly represented as adjacency lists, but there are some simple back-and-forth conversions from that form and into a silly form intended to mirror the more mathematical-theoretical G=(V,E) form in which G is the graph, V is the set of vertices, and E is the set of edges of the graph.
